This week was easy due to this, and I upgraded a boom cannon to level 12. I plan to upgrade all my boom cannons to level 12, then to level 13, and whatever else level I can get them to with my current headquarters level.

I additionally plan to upgrade all my boom cannons to level 12, then to level 13, and whatever else level I can get them to with my current headquarters level. I got attacked twice since I last played, the first attack was unsuccessful, and the second attack was successful, but it wasn't much of a loss to me, as I didn't have very much wood, or stone on me, and I had far too much gold and iron. The attacker probably needed it more than I do, too bad you can't just donate resources to people. I did a submarine dive. Afterwards, I quit. - 2022, Sunday, September 4th

<!-- Notes 2023.02.12
scorcher upgrade available, I didn't know I would unlock so many by just 1 armory upgrade
Scorcher is my toughest troop, having more hitpoints in 1 unit than any building (excluding the headquarters) in my base, it is like having 8 portable headquarters buildings that can defend themselves. My scorcher (unboosted) has close to 40000 hp. I could have a level 1 cannon target it for the entire duration of a battle, and it wouldn't die from it. Someday, I am hoping the same can be said, but for a level 1 boom cannon

I have a an upgrade in mind: getting one of my machine guns to the highest level possible. I have noted that a max level machine gun can actually widdle down the health of my scorchers pretty quickly, and the level 20 and beyond machine guns look really cool as well. I additionally plan to upgrade all my boom cannons to level 12, then to level 13, and whatever else level I can get them to with my current headquarters level. A lot of the awesome looking buildings (like boom cannon level 15, or machine gun level 21) require a level 21 headquarters. I wonder if I will ever get to that level.

### 2023, Sunday, August 6th

I had a short session today. The game did not require an update today, but was very buggy in the beginning. I attacked the first 5 stages of Dr. Terrors island, not losing any troops on any stages.

My headquarters finished upgrading to level 21. It looks so much better now. The level 22 headquarters looks even more epic, but I am not going to rush my base that much to upgrade it right now.

I continued power stone conversion again this week. I began building 3 shock mines, along with a new boom cannon.

Stone has become very evident to be one of the most difficult resources to get in this game, and it is making it impossible to upgrade anything on a weekly basis. This week was easier, as the new low level building unlocked from upgrading my headquarters to level 21 isn't going to be expensive to upgrade for a few weeks. I also have another upgrade in mind: getting one of my machine guns to the highest level possible. I have noted that a max level machine gun can actually widdle down the health of my scorchers pretty quickly, and the level 20 and beyond machine guns look really cool as well. I additionally plan to upgrade all my boom cannons to level 12, then to level 13, and whatever else level I can get them to with my current headquarters level. Now that I have a level 21 headquarters, I can upgrade my machine guns to level 21.

### 2023, Sunday, August 13th

I had a short session today. The game did not require an update today, and was annoying to operate due to bugging me about updates, and proto troops I don't care for. I attacked the first 5 stages of Dr. Terrors island, not losing any troops until stage 5, where I lost 4 scorchers.

I continued power stone conversion again this week. I began to upgrade a boom cannon to level 2 today.

### 2023, Sunday, August 20th

I had a longer session today. The game did not require an update today, and wasn't as annoying about updates as last week, because it didn't pop up for as long, and there were no proto-troop offers. I attacked the first 6 stages of Dr. Terrors island, not losing any troops until stage 6, where I lost all 8 scorchers, and also the battle.

I continued power stone conversion again this week. 

Stone has become very evident to be one of the most difficult resources to get in this game, and it is making it impossible to upgrade anything on a weekly basis. I began to try and go for a level 21 machine gun today. I opened several trader crates, but it didn't give enough stone. I didn't want to wait any longer, so I went ahead and spent 348 diamonds on 606,128 stone. I can make these diamonds back in about 1-2 months, and they can't go towards anything else anyways.

I also began to upgrade my Medic to level 9 for 5.3 million gold.

I did a submarine dive. Afterwards, I quit. - 2023, Sunday, August 20th

### 2023, Sunday, August 27th

I had a longer session today. The game did not require an update today. I attacked the first 4 stages of Dr. Terrors island, not losing any troops until stage 4, where I lost 1 scorcher. I usually don't lose troops on this stage nowadays, so this was rare.

I continued power stone conversion again this week. 

Stone has become very evident to be one of the most difficult resources to get in this game, and it is making it impossible to upgrade anything on a weekly basis. My top machine gun is now level 21, but the level 22 one looks even better. I will not rush my base for it though. This week, I upgraded a boom cannon to level 3, as I couldn't afford any other upgrades.

The Tribal Mega Crab event was active this week, and I made it to stage 14 with 7 out of 8 scorchers.

My top machine gun is now level 21, but the level 22 one looks even better. I will not rush my base for it though. This week, the trader offered a very large amount of stone for only a few million gold. I was wanting to do an upgrade in my armory or to Dr. Kavan, and felt slightly bad about not doing so, but this stone is so much more important. I was able to upgrade a second boom cannon to level 14 today because of it. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough stone to do the level 15 boom cannon upgrade.

I did a submarine dive. Afterwards, I quit. - 2023, Sunday, September 17th

This week, I was scammed out of 3 trades, as the gold for stone trade was offered to me too early, and I missed out on nearly 4 million stone, as I didn't have enough gold stockpiled. I was still able to upgrade a cannon to level 18 today, but I was disappointed with my luck with the trader.

I did not do any upgrades this week. I was not attacked since I last played, but a village was lost. Regardless, I won't be able to upgrade regardless, as I didn't have enough resources. I activated a second builder for free, but basically wasted it, as there is no way I can upgrade 2 buildings in 1 week at the current rate. I received 150 diamonds for free as a gift, and accidentally skipped over the traders Christmas message, something I was upset with myself for doing.

- I had a much longer session today. The game did not require an update today. I attacked the first 5 stages of Dr. Terrors island, not losing any troops on any stages.
- I went after several players and NPCs today to get wood and iron, as I really wanted to upgrade my Boom Cannon to level 15. Eventually, I decided that spending a little over 500 diamonds for this was justified, as I have wanted it for a really long time (multiple years) I considered saving up and doing it next week, but I feared someone would come and rob me in that time. I should level up to level 58 by next week.

- I continued power stone conversion again this week.
- I was not attacked since I last played (on my main island) however, I lost a couple of islands (the attacker had the clever username of `fire` which made it read `village lost to fire` it was funny, similar to that of the `Your village is being raided by God` message in Clash of Clans, but not as funny)

- 2 of the 3 resource bases I captured last week were invaded, and I lost them. I see the loss as a bit unfair, as the players that took them back were level 76 (the current max player level) while I am only level 58. I still received a bit of iron from these bases prior to their capture.

### 3D Touch issues

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

- While playing today, I constantly dealt with issues related to my posture of holding the device (which caused constant errors, and sporadic screengrabs) and the return of an annoying bug that made the game do nothing but zoom in and out with little control. The only fix is to turn the screen off, back on, quickly minimize the game, maximimize it, then quickly turn the screen off again, back on, quickly minimize the game again, and maximize it. It was so annoying. Sometimes it would start doing it again after the next screengrab. - 2021 November 28th

- 3D touch issues were minimal today, but screenshot issues were through the roof. I find it idiotic that the power button on my device goes towards a voice "Assistant" that I don't use, rather than its actual purpose. Why not make a VA/Bixby button? While you are at it, why not make a screenshot button? You know, no VA button, virtual assistants don't need a button, a search assistant doesn't need a button. - 2022 January 30th to 2022 February 6th

Formal definitions (finally added on 2023, Sunday, April 9th)

- **3D touch (obsolete):** See `Edge screen` and `Pinch-zoom`
- **Edge screen:** Issues related to posture (closing menu dialog due to touching the screen edge)
- **Pinch-zoom:** Android bug where after certain screenshots, there is no control, and every action you make either zooms in or zooms out the game. It sometimes corrects on its own, but it sometimes requires turning the screen off, turning it back on, minimizing the application, then maximimizing the application.
- **Red text:** Text such as `All forces deployed` showing up in screenshots due to accidental screen presses.

This attack was a major loss, with nearly 1 million wood, nearly 400000 iron, less than 100000 gold, and less than 100000 stone, a major loss. I can't ever see the replay, so I never know how they do it, but I always notice a similar pattern of troop layout. - 2022, Sunday, May 8th

- I did not do any player attacks yet again this week, but I got attacked twice since I last played, the first attack was unsuccessful, and the second attack was successful, but it wasn't much of a loss to me, as I didn't have very much wood, or stone on me, and I had far too much gold and iron. The attacker probably needed it more than I do, too bad you can't just donate resources to people. - 2022, Sunday, September 4th

- Upon loading, I found that I was demoted, and due to a collision with the super troop announcement, the game randomly crashed. Upon reloading, I was unable to view my base, as someone was attacking me live. What are the odds? The attack was successful, and was done by someone nearly 20 levels higher than me.

#### Consideration

- I am considering letting all bases get reclaimed, so that people stop attacking me every single week, so that I can come back later when I am more advanced and have some easy wins. For now, I have decided to just not attack any players. (Decision started on Sunday, May 9th 2021) I failed on this goal on June 20th 2021, as I was desperate to get my headquarters to level 20. I am continuing the goal again, but I am likely to break it again. - As of July 25th 2021

### Excessive notifications

- After the update on 2023, September 24th, the game has started to give notifications again. I have found them to be a bit excessive. - 2023, Sunday, October 1st

## SUPERCELL ID

```id=center

```

When playing Clash of Clans today (right before playing Boom Beach) I created my SUPERCELL ID to make backing this game up an easier process, and to get 50 gems. I really like the level of thought that was put into the cosmetics of the SUPERCELL ID Account. I would go on and apply it to my Boom Beach account. I would get it connected to Clash Royale and Hay Day, but I don't want to disturb those accounts. - 2024, Sunday, October 13th
